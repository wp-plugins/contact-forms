Quickly create and publish forms in your WordPress powered website.

== Description ==

Forms are a must for any website. WordPress Contact Forms is the result of years of experience building and developing business websites of all sorts, focused on collecting as many first time contacts and leads as possible. It is ideal for both single and multiple language sites, simple blogs or complex Wordpress powered Content Management Systems.  If your website needs to handle serveral kinds of forms then our plugin is certainly an excellent choice.

Select the fields you need, configure on-screen messages and email responses, preview, test and easily embed the form in your posts, pages or custom content types using the TinyMCE button.

Create as many forms as you want. Create landing pages, contact pages, invitations, a jobs form with curriculum upload, customer request forms, spare part requests and much more. 

= Make better forms with WordPress Contact Forms =

Don't leave anything to chance and fine tune the entire form submittal process.

Choose or create the fields you need from 17 available field types. 

Give custom labels to form elements and set up error messages for each field.

= Online Success Messages =
Each form can have its own online success message. That way when a form is completed. for example you can allow access to a link for a file download, give coupon information, or just use text to make sure that the form was submitted correctly.

And in the rare case something does not work properly you can customise an error message for each form as well.

= Email Notifications =
Send email notifications to administrators. WordPress Contact Forms has a token system that can be used to give administrators tracking information such as visitor IP, referrer... 

Send an email notification to the visitor as further confirmation that the form was filled in correctly.

All email notifications can be tested in the Preview/Test Tab.

= Collect data and export to Excel =
All data submitted is stored in your WordPress database and can be filtered, searched and exported to excel at any time. You can export all data or just the data you need. The Advanced Excel Export option allows you to export to a file with ready-to-use filtering options. 

Wordpress Contact forms has a graph to show the performance of your website forms in time.
